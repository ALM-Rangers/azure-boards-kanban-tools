#Welcome to Visual Studio Team Services Extensions!

###This project template was put together to help you get started quickly with VSTS extension development.  The following components are included:

- The `VSS.SDK.js` file, required for JavaScript interaction with VSTS
- The `vss-extension.json` file, needed to define the metadata of the extension you are developing
- A simple `index.html` page, used to display content in your extension
- A `gruntfile.js` file to leverage GruntJS for running the `tfx` package and publish commands
- An app.ts TypeScript file, which gives you a very simple timekeeping module
- A sample logo file (replace this with the logo you wish to use for your extension)
- A sample Jasmine spec file (`test/TestSpec.js`) to help get you started with the Jasmine testing framework (special thanks to [Niel Zeeman](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2013/11/01/introducing-the-visual-studio-alm-rangers-niel-zeeman.aspx))

This has been updated to be inline with the [M95](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/integrate/extensions/support/release-notes) release, which includes support for VSTS hosting of static content (.html,.css,.js) and the use of the tfx utility.

####If you run into any issues with the version of Node that is installed with the Node.js Tools for Visual Studio, you can change the path to Node by going into Tools -> Options -> Projects and Solutions -> External Web Tools.
